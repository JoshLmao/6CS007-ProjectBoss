## Preparation

Before launching the game, you will need to have python configured on your system.  Once Python is setup, you then need to run the ```install-py-requirements.bat``` file to install the required packages for Python. 

### Python

Recommended version: [3.6.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/)

Download the ```Windows x86-64 executable installer``` for an automated installer. When installing, enable the "Add Python to environment variables" checkbox.

### Python: pip

As well as Python, you will need to make sure pip is installed for Python. For more information, [check here]( https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

To play, click the .exe file to launch.
